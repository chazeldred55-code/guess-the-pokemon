## Introduction
This web application is a **Pokémon guessing game** designed to test a user’s Pokémon knowledge in a fun and interactive way.

- The **home page** introduces the game and its theme.
- The **game page** displays a silhouette image of a Pokémon.
- The user enters a guess into a text input and submits it.
- Two buttons are available:
  - **Submit Guess** – checks the player’s answer.
  - **Next Pokémon** – skips to the next Pokémon.
- The user receives immediate feedback for each guess.
- A running score is maintained throughout the game.
- After **20 rounds**, the final score is displayed and the game can be restarted.

---
## Value to Users

Provides a quick, casual Pokémon knowledge challenge (entertainment value).

Encourages repeat play with shuffled order and a high score to beat.

Instant feedback (“Correct/Wrong”) makes the game feel responsive and rewarding.

Low-friction: no login, no setup, works in browser on desktop and mobile.

Accessible interaction: simple controls + Enter-to-submit.
## Purpose and Value
**Purpose:**  
To provide a lightweight, replayable Pokémon guessing game that delivers immediate feedback and a clear sense of progression across a fixed number of rounds.

**Value to players:**
- Simple and intuitive gameplay requiring no instructions.
- Immediate feedback reinforces engagement.
- A final score encourages replay and self-competition.
- Skip functionality ensures the player never becomes stuck.

**Value as a portfolio project:**
- Demonstrates interactive front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Shows state management, DOM manipulation, defensive input handling, and event-driven logic.
- Includes both manual and automated testing with documented results.
- Fully deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.

**Value to Site Owner:**
- Demonstrates clean separation of logic and presentation.
- Shows testing discipline through Jest and Lighthouse.
- Acts as a reusable template for future browser-based games.

## UX Design Rationale

### Layout and Information Hierarchy
- A **two-page flow** (Home → Game) minimises cognitive load.
- The Pokémon image is the primary visual focus, with controls positioned directly beneath for intuitive interaction.

### User Control and Feedback
- Submit and Skip buttons give the user full control.
- Immediate feedback confirms user actions.
- The end-of-game overlay provides closure and encourages replay.

### Visual Design
- A restrained colour palette improves readability and avoids distraction.
- Consistent button styles reinforce affordances across pages.

### Accessibility Considerations
- Clear text contrast and readable font sizes.
- Keyboard support (Enter key submits guesses).
- Responsive layout supports mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
### Design choice
The restrained colour palette was deliberately chosen over a more vibrant theme to avoid distracting from the Pokémon silhouettes, which are the core gameplay element. High-contrast colours were prioritised to ensure feedback messages remain readable across devices and lighting conditions.

## Features
- Randomised Pokémon order each playthrough.
- No duplicate Pokémon within a single game.
- Case-insensitive guess validation.
- Empty input validation with user feedback.
- Skip functionality.
- Score and wrong-guess tracking.
- End-of-round results overlay.
- Keyboard input support.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap.
- Custom 404 page redirecting users back to the home page.

- **Jest** – automated unit testing.
- **ChatGPT** – documentation support.

---

## Testing Principles
Testing was conducted using both **manual** and **automated** approaches.

- **Manual testing** verifies user journeys and UI behaviour.
- **Automated testing** ensures core logic remains reliable.

Testing follows the **RITE** principles:
Readable – Test names clearly describe expected behaviour.
Isolated – Core logic is tested independently of the DOM.
Thorough – Positive and negative cases are covered.
Explicit – Expected outcomes are clearly asserted.

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple-choice mode to reduce input friction.
- Larger Pokémon dataset loaded dynamically.
- Adaptive difficulty (start with common Pokémon, progress to obscure).
- Optional audio or animation feedback.
